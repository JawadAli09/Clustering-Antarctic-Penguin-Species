# Clustering-Antarctic-Penguin-Species
# Arctic Penguin Exploration: Clustering Penguin Data Using K-means

## Overview

In this project, I developed an automated system to analyze and identify clusters within a dataset of penguins from Antarctica using K-means clustering. The dataset contains various measurements of penguins, but lacks species information. By employing machine learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we aim to uncover distinct groups within the data that could correspond to the known species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Analysis and Cleaning**: Handle missing values and outliers to prepare the dataset for clustering.
- **Feature Engineering**: Convert categorical data into a suitable format for machine learning.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use PCA to reduce the complexity of the dataset while retaining important features.
- **Clustering**: Apply K-means clustering to identify potential groups in the data.
- **Visualization**: Create visual representations of the clusters to facilitate understanding.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to infer possible species groups.

## Key Achievements

- **Data Preprocessing**: Successfully cleaned the dataset by addressing missing values and outliers.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Implemented PCA to simplify the data, improving the efficiency of clustering.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Utilized K-means clustering to segment the data into distinct clusters, providing insights into possible species groupings.
- **Visualization**: Generated plots to visualize the clusters and the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Statistical Summary**: Created a statistical summary of each cluster, highlighting differences in key features.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:
- `culmen_length_mm`: Length of the culmen (beak) in millimeters.
- `culmen_depth_mm`: Depth of the culmen in millimeters.
- `flipper_length_mm`: Length of the flipper in millimeters.
- `body_mass_g`: Body mass in grams.
- `sex`: Gender of the penguin.

Data was collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER.

## Future Work

- **Species Identification**: Integrate additional data to better identify species and enhance classification accuracy.
- **Model Enhancement**: Experiment with other clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques for improved results.
- **Broader Application**: Apply the methodology to other datasets for various ecological and biological studies.
